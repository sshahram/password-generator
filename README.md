## User Story

As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria, so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## Acceptance Criteria

* When I click the button to generate a password, then I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* When prompted for password criteria, then I select which criteria to include in the password
* When prompted for the length of the password, then I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* When prompted for character types to include in the password, then I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* When I answer each prompt, then my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* When all prompts are answered, then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* When the password is generated, then the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
